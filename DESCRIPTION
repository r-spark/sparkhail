Description: 'Hail' is an open-source, general-purpose, 'python' based data analysis
    tool with additional data types and methods for working with genomic data, see
    <https://hail.is/>. 'Hail' is built to scale and has first-class support for 
    multi-dimensional structured data, like the genomic data in a genome-wide 
    association study (GWAS). 'Hail' is exposed as a 'python' library, using primitives
    for distributed queries and linear algebra implemented in 'scala', 'spark', and 
    increasingly 'C++'. The 'sparkhail' is an R extension using 'sparklyr' package. 
    The idea is to help R users to use 'hail' functionalities with the well-know
    'tidyverse' syntax, see <https://www.tidyverse.org/>.
